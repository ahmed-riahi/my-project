        <li class ="z">SHONEN</li> 
        <p>Shōnen anime (少年漫画), also romanized as shonen or shounen, are Japanese comics mainly marketed and aimed at a young teen male readership. These graphic novels and comics are primarily for boys between the ages of 12 through 18.[1] The age group varies with individual readers and different magazines. The kanji character 少年 (shōnen) literally means "boy" or "youth", and the character 漫画 (manga) means "comic"; thus, the complete phrase means "young person's comic", or simply "boys' comic", with the female equivalent being shōjo manga. Shōnen manga is the most popular and best-selling form of manga.</p>

        <li class ="z">SHOJO</li>
        <p>Shōjo manga (少女漫画, lit. "girls' comics", also romanized as shojo or shoujo) is an editorial category of Japanese comics targeting an audience of adolescent girls and young adult women. It is, along with shōnen manga (targeting boys and male teens), seinen manga (targeting young adult and adult men), and josei manga (targeting adult women), one of the primary editorial categories of manga. Shōjo manga is traditionally published in dedicated manga magazines, which often specialize in a particular readership age range or narrative genre.</p>

       <li class = "z">KODODOMUKE</li>
       <p>Being an anime fan requires an extensive vocabulary.

        The fandom is populated with all kinds of terms which describe various kinds of shows, and kodomomuke is one which all trips fans up. Sure, phrases like shonen and shojo get tossed around on the regular, but kodomomuke is not something you hear everyday.
